# Rock-Paper-Scissor-App
An Android based App that plays Rock Paper Scissor against the user.

# General Idea and Motivation behind the Project
The general motivation behind this project was, to learn more about different AWS Services. In addition, I wanted to try out, writing a new App using Kotlin. To this point, I only developed apps in native Java code. 

Since I am a Machine Learning Engineer and ML is awesome, I decided to build an image base classification app. However, the ML part of this project was keeped as minimal as possible, so that I have more time to focus on the AWS backend part and a little bit on the kotlin app.
